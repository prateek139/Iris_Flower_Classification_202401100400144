**# Iris Flower Classification**  

### Overview  
This project uses machine learning to classify iris flowers into three species (*Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica*) based on petal and sepal dimensions.  

### Dataset  
Contains 150 samples with four key features:  
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

### Model  
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Accuracy:** ~98%  

### Steps  
1. Preprocess data (cleaning, encoding labels)  
2. Visualize patterns  
3. Split into training/testing sets  
4. Train and evaluate the model  

### Results  
The model performs with high accuracy and minimal misclassifications.
